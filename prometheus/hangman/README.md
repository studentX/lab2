# Hangman Service and CLI

<br/>

## Description

This repo contains sample GO code for playing Hangman. The game relies on
the [dictionary](https://github.com/k8sland/code2/tree/master/dictionary) service
to provide a list of words. The game is composed of a service to pick out a word
from a dictionary list of words and a CLI to play the game.
