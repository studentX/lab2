> The party pooper scheduler! Write a party scheduler that will only schedule
> a pod if it has a costume.

1. Define a custom party scheduler aka partysched, that check if a given pod
   has a costume label set to either ghoul or goblin or your choice of costumes...
1. Make sure your pod gets scheduled if it has a correct costume label
1. For all other cases ie no label or no correct attire, make sure your scheduler
   selected no nodes and spews out a log.
1. Setup a partysched deployment with a service account and RBAC rules
1. Using the given Makefile publish your party scheduler as a Docker container
1. Deploy your party scheduler in your cluster
1. Rinse and repeat your checks in a deployed configuration
1. Delete your application and scheduler!

## Commands

### Run your party scheduler manually

    ```shell
    go run main.go
    ```

### Provision deployment

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f k8s/nginx.yml
    ```

### Build and deploy a Docker image

  > NOTE! Update the Makefile and setup for your DockerHub registry

    ```shell
    make img
    ```

### Deploy your scheduler and nginx deployment

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f k8s
    ```

# Check RBAC Rules for serviceaccount

    ```shell
    ku auth can-i get pods -n defaut --as system:serviceaccount:default:partysched
    ```
