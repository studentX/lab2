> The party pooper scheduler! Write a party scheduler that will only schedule
> a pod if it has a costume.

1. Define a custom party scheduler aka partysched, that checks if a given pod
   has a costume label set to either ghoul or goblin and matches node costumes...
2. Make sure your pod gets scheduled on a node with the same costume as to pod's costume label
3. For all other cases ie no label or incorrect attire, make sure your scheduler
   selected no nodes and spews out a log.
4. Setup a partysched deployment with a service account and RBAC rules
5. Using the given Makefile publish your party scheduler as a Docker container
6. Deploy your party scheduler in your cluster
7. Rinse and repeat your checks in a deployed configuration
8. Delete your application and scheduler!

## Commands

### Run your party scheduler manually

    ```shell
    go run main.go
    ```

### Provision deployment

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f k8s/nginx.yml
    ```

### Build and deploy a Docker image

  > NOTE! Update the Makefile and setup for your DockerHub registry

    ```shell
    make img
    ```

### Deploy your scheduler and nginx deployment

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f k8s
    ```

# Check RBAC Rules for serviceaccount

    ```shell
    kubectl auth can-i get nodes \
      --namespace default \
      --as system:serviceaccount:default:partysched
    ```
