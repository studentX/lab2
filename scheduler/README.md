> In the spirit of Halloween, write a party scheduler that will only schedule
> a pod if it has a costume.

1. Define a custom party scheduler aka partysched, that check if a given pod
   has a costume label set to either ghoul or goblin or your choice of costumes...
2. Make sure your pod gets scheduled if it has a correct costume label
3. For all other cases ie no label or no correct attire, make sure your scheduler
   selected no nodes and spews out a log.
4. Setup a partysched deployment with a service account and RBAC rules
5. Using the given Makefile publish your party scheduler as a Docker container
6. Deploy your party scheduler in your cluster
7. Rinse and repeat your checks in a deployed configuration

## Commands

```shell
# Check RBAC Rules for serviceaccount
ku auth can-i get pods -n defaut --as system:serviceaccount:default:partysched
 ```
