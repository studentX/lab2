> G.O.T Reloaded!

In this lab, we are going to decorate a web server using **OpenTracing**.
There are 2 services involved: **Castle** and **Knight**. The
Knights want to melt Castles, but if you're a G.O.T fan, you already
know that only the NightKing can melt a Castle using his undead üêâ...

The Knight service accepts post requests on */v1/melt* and issues a
post */v1/melt* on the Castle service with a given Knight name.
The Castle service returns either a 200 with a castle melted message if the
knight is the NightKing or a 417 error with *only NightKing can melt* otherwise.

<br/>

NOTE: Skip the first 6 steps if no GO chops!

1. Instrument the Castle service by tracing incoming *melt* requests (SKIP IF NO GO CHOPS!!)
  1. Edit your Castle trace and add the following tags to the trace:
    1. http.method
    1. http.url
    1. knight
1. If the given Knight is *NightKing* add a log to the castle span to indicate
   `the castle is melted`.
1. All other knights should produce a span error (internal/http.go).
1. Span errors are indicated by:
   1. Setting a span tag error=true
   1. Adding a structured log on the span using
      1. event=error
      1. message=only the Nightking can melt the castle
1. Edit the provided Makefile to use your own docker **registry**!
1. Build and push new docker images using the Makefile (see commands below!)
1. Deploy Jaeger, Castle and Knight services on your local cluster.
   1. You will need to modify the K8s manifest to use your image names (castle, knight)
1. Validate that your traces are correctly tracking the workload by using
   different knights.
1. Delete the entire application!

## Commands

### Setup Jaeger

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f k8s/jaeger.yml
    # Jaeger UI
    open http://$(minikube ip):30600/
    ```

### Build your code and publish your own docker images

   > NOTE! You must change the Docker registry to use your own user account!

    ```shell
    cd got
    make push
    ```

### Deploy your services

   > NOTE! Edit the manifest and update the Docker image names

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f k8s/got
    ```

### Test your endpoints and traces

      ```shell
      http $(minikube ip):30501/v1/melt knight=tim
      # Or...
      curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://$(minikube ip):30501/v1/melt -d '{"knight":"nightking"}'
      ```
