# <img src="../assets/lab.png" width="32" height="auto"/> Painter CRD Lab

> Leveraging Kubebuilder, define a painter CRD to color all pods in a given namespace.

1. *Coloring a pod* is defined as setting a color label on a pod equaling the CRD specific color
1. Define a CR to include a color property. Leverage the built-in enum validator
   to only include: Red, Blue and Green. Make sure to leverage annotations!
1. Implement a painter controller to monitor your painter CRD and pods as follows:
  1. When a painter CRD is created or updated, all pods in that namespace
     must be painted the CRD specified color.
  1. When a painter CRD is deleted, all pods color labels in that namespace must be removed!
  1. When a new pod is added or updated, its color label must be updated accordingly
1. Write tests to ensure your controller is operating nominally
1. In your local cluster, deploy your painter controller and ensure it exhibits the
   correct behaviors
1. Delete your crds and application!

## Commands

### Create your custom resource

> NOTE!! Run only if you're planning to implement the GO CRD, skip otherwise.

```shell
kubebuilder create api --group workload --version v1alpha1 --kind Painter
```

### Test your controller

```shell
make test
```

### Deploy your Painter CRD Schema

```shell
make install
```

### Run your Painter controller from the command line

```shell
make run
```

### Deploy your CRD instance

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/samples/blue.yml
# Paint all nginx pods blue?
kubectl apply -f k8s/nginx.yml
# Verify!
kubectl get po -l app=nginx --show-labels
# Change crd to green and watch the label change!
```

### Dockerize your controller

```shell
make docker-build IMG=CHANGE_ME_DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER_NAME/painter-manager:0.0.1
```

### Deploy your Docker image to a registry (DockerHub)

> NOTE! You must create or use a Docker registry account!

```shell
docker login
make docker-push IMG=CHANGE_ME_DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER_NAME/painter-manager:0.0.1
```

### Delete all previous deployments!

```shell
kubectl delete -f config/samples -f k8s/nginx.yml
```

### Deploy your controller

```shell
make deploy
```

### Deploy your crd

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/samples/blue.yml
```

### Deploy nginx in your namespace

Using the lab template k8s directory...

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/nginx.yml
```

### Validate your pods are painted

```shell
kubectl get po --show-labels
```
