> Leverage Init Containers to provision dictionaries for a Dictionary service.

The dictionary service will load dictionary data from a given asset directory and
dictionary name mounted on a volume. Use an init-container to provision the
volume with a set of dictionaries by cloning a dictionary assets repo.

1. Define a pod using the following Docker image:
   k8sland/go-dictionary-svc:0.0.3
1. The dictionary service takes in an asset directory containing word dictionaries
   and a dictionary filename ie trick_or_treat.txt.
   The service uses the following command:

   ```shell
   /app/dictionary -a dictionary_dir -d dictionary_name
   ```

1. This service runs on port 4000 and exposes /words endpoint to list out the words
   contained in the dictionary loaded via *-a/d* options above.
1. Define an init container to provision a volume to be used by the dictionary
   service. The init container needs to clone this repo
   [Dictionaries](https://github.com/k8sland/dictionaries.git) in order to
   provision the volume
1. Next change the init container command to cause the pod to fail
1. What's happening with your dictionary pod?
1. Delete you pod!

## Commands

1. Launch your pod
2. Verify the init container is successful and pod is launched
3. Verify the volume was provisioned correctly

    ```shell
    kubectl exec -it dictionary -- wget -qO- http://localhost:4000/words
    ```

4. Change git url so that it does not resolve
