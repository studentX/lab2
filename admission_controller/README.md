> Trick or Treat? Provision your cluster with a dynamic admission controller
> that rejects all Grim Reaper's deployments!

NOTE: Skip step 1 if no GO chops!

1. Update the code in main.go to reject all grim reaper deployments. ie
   check for deployment resource with a label app=Grim-Reaper.
1. Generate certs and keys for your webhook and make sure to provide the correct
   service name in your certificate encryption
1. Generate a ca_bundle to validate api-server callback into your webhook.
1. Set the ca_bundle in k8s/adm.yml to the output of the previous command
1. Deploy your admission controller
1. Register your validating admission controller with the api-server
1. Update the provided grim deployment with the magic label and provision your cluster
1. Trace the api-server logs and your admission controller logs to ensure all
   are working nominally.
1. Verify your deployment was denied for the right reason
1. Delete your deployment and change/remove the label
1. Redeploy and make sure your admission controller allows the new deployment
1. Delete your application!

1. Base64 encode your certificate

    ```shell
    # If not already installed and OSX?
    brew install pbcopy
    # Base64 encode your key
    cat caCert.pem | base64 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
    # IMPORTANT! Edit k8s/adm.yml and paste in caBundle
    ```

1. Update the validating admission webhook caBundle with your key
1. Deploy and validate your validating admission webhook
